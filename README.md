EnergyNOC
=========

The EnergyNOC project is providing infrastructure and user experiences
supporting the management of energy operations at the facilities and
ecodistrict level.

Energy management, as a central topic, is provided through the
integration of applicable interoperability protocoals defined in the
SGIP Catalog of Standards.

The project is to provide management consoles that allow role based
interactions to monitor and control facility entities. The console is
browser based and provides a framework within which modular plug-ins
may be configured. Plug-ins enable monitoring and control of specific
device classes, such as lighting devices, and give the operational
facilities manager the capability of turning devices on/off and
monitoring their operational characteristics.
